# Product Description
A farm management web app used to monitor livestock, bins, etc. Relying primarily on mobile for farmers to input and view data. 

# Need and value
Agriculture applications are in there infancy. Many farmers are using paper to keep track of things and if they are using computers, relying on non-purpose built software. We aim to work with farmers and find out exactly what they need to streamline their work. This is where the value of our app comes from. We save them time and money. There is tremendous potential for app stickiness as once their data is in our system, itâ€™s a significant time expenditure to switch. 

# Stakeholders
Our basic stakeholder and ideal consumers are local producers and operators in the Agriculture sector who we hope to improve quality of life and encourage innovation but whose data we will be in possession of. Some other potential stakeholders are researchers who might be interested in some of the user information for easy to access to quantitative data about new practices and methodologies being implemented in the Ag-sector. 

# Technical requirements
We believe that a web application is the best way to serve our stakeholders. So we would be using HTML, CSS, and we are looking at various frameworks that allow us to use Python or Java to create the logic part of the app. We will also need to use a database technology like SQL to store data and a server to sync with the web app.
